# Modules

Examples of the creation and usage of various features of Ultimate Fields within the  __Ultimate Fields: Showcase Theme__ are combined in purpose-built modules.

Modules are activated from the "Theme Options" page, located in Appearance > Theme Options when the theme is active. In the table below you can find which modules are using a specific location or a specific field type.

Each module is contained in a separate directory within this folder and contains a special `readme.md` file, which describes the purpose of the module, what features are used and how they are used.
